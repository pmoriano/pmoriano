## About me

I am Pablo Moriano. I am a researcher in the [Computer Science and Mathematics Division](https://csmd.ornl.gov/) at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/). I use data-driven and computational models to discover and understand critical security issues in large-scale networked systems. I rely on this approach to design and develop innovative solutions to address these. Applications of my research range across multiple disciplines, including, the detection of exceptional events in social media, Internet route hijacking modeling, insider threat behavior in version control systems, and intrusion detection in cyber-physical systems.
