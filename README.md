## About me

I am Pablo Moriano. I am a researcher in the [Computer Science and Mathematics Division](https://csmd.ornl.gov/) at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/). I use data-driven and computational models to discover and understand critical security issues in large-scale networked systems. I rely on this approach to design and develop innovative solutions to address these. Applications of my research range across multiple disciplines, including, the [detection of exceptional events in social media](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40137-0), [Internet route hijacking modeling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128621000207), [insider threat behavior in version control systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3139923.3139928), and [intrusion detection in cyber-physical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02665).
